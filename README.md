# Plotting pairwise kS distributions for paralogous genes.

### Synopsis

Whole genome duplications are thought to have been important in the evolution of plant genomes. Using synonymous substitutions as a rough proxy for time since divergence of paralogous sequences, provides a method for estimating temporally clustered gene duplications. This project aims to provide an easy pipeline for plotting kS (synonymous substitutions) distributions for any set of CDS.

As an example, this is the kS plot for ORF predicted from a de novo assembly of the olive transcriptome (data from [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/GABQ00000000.1) published by [Muñoz-Mérida et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576661/) The plot shows evidence for one or more large scale gene duplication events.
